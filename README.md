GuessTheWord

A simple console-based game where the user has to guess a word by entering letters one by one.

This is a simple command-line game where the player has to guess a hidden word before running out of lives. The player can input a letter at each turn, and if the letter is in the word, it will be revealed. Otherwise, the player loses a life.
How to Play

To play the game, run the GuessTheWord.java file in your IDE or from the command line. The game will start, and a random word will be chosen from a list of pre-defined words. The length of the word will be displayed as underscores, and the player has to guess the word letter by letter.

The player can input a letter at each turn, and if the letter is in the word, it will be revealed. Otherwise, the player loses a life. The game continues until the player guesses the word or runs out of lives. The player starts with three lives.
Installation

To run the game, you will need to have Java installed on your computer.
