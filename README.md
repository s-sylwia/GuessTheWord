## Description

The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player's task is to guess the word by providing letters one at a time. The player has a limited number of lives, and for each incorrect letter, a life is deducted. The game ends either when the player guesses the word correctly or when all lives are exhausted.

## How to Play

2. The game will display a series of underscores representing the word to be guessed.
3. Enter a letter and press Enter.
4. If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word.
5. If the letter is incorrect, a message will be displayed, and a life will be deducted.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the word is guessed or all lives are exhausted.
7. The game will display a victory message if the word is guessed or a defeat message if all lives are used up.
